## Because why not?

I've always been fascinated by ASCII art and how it's possible to generate recognizable, near-photorealistic images using only text characters.
Although the creation of these artworks always seemed like magic, it's a fairly straightforward conversion of pixel brightness values to a list of monospaced text characters that take up varying degrees of whitespace.

## If still images are magic...

After completing an online AI course, I was looking for projects to use with the Computer Vision library, and this seemed like a fun application.  Like anything else, getting the proof of concept done was the easy part; making a polished program took 90% of th time.
